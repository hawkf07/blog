# This is what i learned after making homemade vinegar
Not so long ago,  i started learning about fermentation like how to make bread, vinegar fermentation, etc. because i, sometimes have some fruits scrap and then i look online that you can make vinegar out of it. it is really simple. 
first take your fruits scrap, like peel, etc. cut into small pieces or you can use your blender to do the job, this is more recommended because it increase surface area so the fermentation can go more effectively. My first vinegar fermentation used melon and dragonfruit peel.
After that you need some fermentation vessel, like food grade plastic, glass, jar, just don't use metal because it can cause metal contamination to the vinegar. Also make sure it is clean, and use some hot water to clean it first(this is what i do) to prevent some bacterial contamination. in short make sure the vessel is properly sanitize to avoid unwanted things to happen.
put the fruits into the vessel and pour some water(just eye ball it), you can add sugar if you want.
add some vinegar mother, i use tapai or tape starter for rice. just wait 2 week or up to one month to make the sugar content of the fruit to turn into alcohol make sure you open  the vessel periodically to release some carbon dioxide(the bi-product of the fermentation), after that you can ferment the alcohol into vinegar for about 1-3 month. cover it cheesecloth or coffee filter.   
# The Vinegar
## The melon vinegar
the vinegar turn out taste like, vinegar.But the sweet melon taste doesn't appear brightly, it has really strong scent,it have a melon like liquid really similar to the fruit color. i use it for cooking purposes the scent sometimes can be smelled because it is really strong, sometimes i cook my food just a little longer to make it disappear, it is add a nice fruit note.I also tries to drink it, but i add a sugar to it, it have a nice taste.I still have it until now, i use it to kickstart other vinegar fermentation. but i think if you want to make the vinegar from melon, just use the fruit, i feel it will turn out more nicer.
# Dragon fruit

The dragon fruit vinegar, i think it is the best one. It have a bright red color(i use the red dragon fruit) which is very nice. the taste is good, i can drink it with itself(diluted with water of course). but i make mistake to take out it to early from the main container, which make the vinegar stale.

# Summary
-  make sure you choose a good quality ingredients 
-  sanitation is really important to make sure its safety
-  if you smell something really odd or the vinegar contaminated with mold or others. just throw it and make a new one
do your own research if you want to make homemade vinegar, because it is really vary depending on your region,etc...
