after learning the basic of HTML, CSS, and Javascript you also need to step up to learn another libraries or framework.One of the best library that really good to learn as beginner, is React.So why do i need to learn React?.

Well, because it is simple and easy to learn.Compared to other library like[Vue](https://vuejs.org/), React is more make to me sense after learning the basic of the Javascript because of the [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) syntax. You can directly write HTML-like syntax in Javascript, some people don't like JSX, but personally i like it.
Here is the example of JSX Syntax:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

function ExampleComponent(){

React hook to manage stateful logic within component

const [state,setState] = useState(0)

const increment = () => setState(state+1)

return (
<div>
{// you can directly bind your variable to the HTML by using bracket}
<p> count {state} </p>
 <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
</div>
)
}
```

React also has a great community support.You can find many libraries or framework written by react.React itself is really great, but you also need a framework to developt more complex and large application.One of the best React framework is[NextJS](https://nextjs.org). it trusted by many big companies to write complex application.

## Summary

- React is simple and easy to learn, especially with its JSX syntax.
- It has a supportive community and a wide range of additional libraries and frameworks.
- Next.js is a popular framework choice for developing complex React applications.

# How to learn react

Personally, I believe that setting a goal is essential when learning React or anything new.Having a clear goal provides motivation and a sense of accomplishment as you progress.Even building a simple application like a todo list can be a motivating experience because you are constantly learning and achieving your goals.
